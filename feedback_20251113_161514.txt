suggestions for improvement:
- The code fulfills most of the requirements but lacks explicit TypeScript generics in the `DataFetcher` component as specified in the prompt. While types are used throughout the code, the component itself isn't explicitly generic.
- Error handling could be improved by providing more specific error messages or implementing retry mechanisms for API calls.
- Consider moving the API URL to a configuration file or environment variable for better maintainability.
- The styling is minimal; consider adding more CSS for a better user experience as suggested in the optional enhancements.
