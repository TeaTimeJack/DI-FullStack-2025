suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using a more descriptive name for the slice, such as 'dailyPlanner'.
- While not explicitly stated, consider including error handling (e.g., validating date format) in the reducers.
- For larger applications, consider normalizing the state (e.g., having a separate 'days' object to hold tasks by date) to improve performance and scalability.

suggestions for improvement:
- The application lacks the calendar/date picker component as described in Step 3. Currently, it's using a simple date input.
- The filtering of tasks based on the selected day is not implemented. The application displays all tasks regardless of the day, failing to address Step 6.
- The `editTheTask` function could be improved by using the current values of `name` and `date` as default values for `name2` and `date2`. Otherwise, it's not possible to edit the date/time without editing the name.
- Consider adding input validation to prevent users from entering invalid task names or dates.
- Add more styling to the component
