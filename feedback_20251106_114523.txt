suggestions for improvement:
- The Redux store and slice logic should be defined in separate files, not directly imported from the component. The instruction specifies creating a Redux Toolkit slice and initializing the store.
- The `TodoItem` component should be extracted to improve code organization and reusability as specified in the instructions.
- The `addTodo` action should ideally handle the creation of a unique ID for each todo item within the reducer. This ensures that each todo is uniquely identified.
- Consider adding input validation to the `AddTodo` component to prevent adding empty tasks.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider exporting the entire `tasksSlice.actions` object instead of individual actions for better organization.
- While `findIndex` and `splice` are generally fine for small arrays, consider using more performant methods if the todo list grows very large.
