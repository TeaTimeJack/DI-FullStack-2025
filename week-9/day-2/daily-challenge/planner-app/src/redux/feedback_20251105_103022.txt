suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only sets up the Redux store provider and renders a `Tasks` component. It doesn't implement any of the core functionality described in the chapter content, such as date picking, task creation/editing/deletion, or display of tasks for a specific day.
- The `Tasks` component is a placeholder and does not address the prompt. It needs to implement the UI elements to interact with Redux store to allow the user to perform CRUD operations on tasks for a specific date.
- The Redux store, actions, and reducers for managing tasks are not implemented in the given code. Implement those to store data and update the store on user actions.
