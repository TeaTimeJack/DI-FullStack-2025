suggestions for improvement:
- The `setTimeout` in `createAsyncThunk` should return a promise to properly handle asynchronous operations. Currently, it's just scheduling a timeout and not waiting for it to resolve before returning the thunk's value.
- The logic within the `useEffect` hook can be simplified.  Instead of managing separate `buttonUpClicked` and `buttonDownClicked` state variables, you could directly dispatch the async thunks in the `handleClickUp` and `handleClickDown` functions.
- Consider displaying a loading indicator in the UI based on the `status` in the store, as suggested in the instructions.
