suggestions for improvement:
- The `BuggyCounter` and `ErrorBoundary` components are missing, making it impossible to fully evaluate the correctness of the simulation.
- The Lifecycle exercises are not addressed in the provided code.  You need to implement the `shouldComponentUpdate`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` methods as described in Exercise 2, and address Exercise 3.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code is a good start for the BuggyCounter component, but it needs to be integrated with an ErrorBoundary component as described in Exercise 1 to fully address the problem.
- The ErrorBoundary component itself is missing, so the error handling functionality is incomplete.
- Consider adding prop validation to the component.
