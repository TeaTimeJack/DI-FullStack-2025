suggestions for improvement:
- Implement the `handleSubmit` function to construct the URL with the form data and redirect the user to that URL on submit.  Currently, the `handleSubmit` function is commented out and doesn't create the URL as specified in the instructions.
- Instead of individual state variables for each input, consider using a single state object to manage the form data. This can simplify the `handleChange` function and make the code more maintainable.
- The checkbox inputs all have the same name (`yesno`). This is not correct and will make it impossible to distinguish between the checkboxes. Each checkbox needs a unique name to be properly handled by the form.
Correctness: 60%
