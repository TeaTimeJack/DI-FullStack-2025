This article will explain the importance of a good pitch. To help you understand i will start with a true story.
Yesterday i had to pitch a project ive been working on - the project was awesome! It had lots of cool features, it was very beautifully desained and very user freindly.
It had everything you want from a good project.
I worked on it for hours, i was realy proud of it but then i needed to pitch it. 
I didn't prepare for the pitch, i thought my project was good enough to speak for its own.
